# HybridTurbulenceModel
The library and utilities for combining URANS and LES approaches for modelling turbulent flows by means of zonal isolation of the computational domain. It is recommended to use modified schemes for LES approache (see https://github.com/eacfd/libSchemes).

The library is available for next OpenFOAM+ versions: 
+ v1812 is in the digitef-dev-1812 branch of the repository
+ v1912 is in the master and digitef-dev-1912 branches of the repository

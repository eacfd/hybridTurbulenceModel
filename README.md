# HybridTurbulenceModel
The library and utilities for combining URANS and LES approaches for modelling turbulent flows by means of zonal isolation of the computational domain. It is recommended to use modified schemes for LES approache (see https://github.com/eacfd/libSchemes).

If you use this library in your research, please cite next article:
